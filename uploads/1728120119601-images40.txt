These filters combine fast flow rates with high loading capacity and the retention of very fine particles, extending into the sub-micron range. Can be used at temperatures up to 500°C and are ideal for use in applications involving air filtration and for gravimetric analysis of volatile materials where ignition is involved. They have a fine capillary structure and can absorb significantly larger quantities of water than an equivalent cellulose filter, making  them suitable for sport tests and liquid scintillation counting methods. Can also be made completely transparent for subsequent microscopic examination.	10370308	Glass Filter, Grade GF10, 150 mm, 100/pk			GBS 10370308	pk	254.4400	0		14-21 Days	9	Lab Equipment & Accessories	1059	Filter Papers & Membranes	1030	Glass Microfiber Filters	N	N
