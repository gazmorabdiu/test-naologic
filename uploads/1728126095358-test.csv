For use in any procedure that requires Trendelenburg, Reverse Trendelenburg, or lateral positioning.  Made with microscipic air capsules that offer immediate rebound, anit-skid properties, enhanced breathability and increased patient support.  Not temperature sensitive and sissipates heat faster than memory foam.  Provides up to 4 times greater peak pressure reduction compared with memory foam.  Single patient use due to the dissipation of static properties with each use and to aid in infection prevention.  Compatible with patient warming devices.  Single-packed in compressed format which lowers shipping costs and reduces storage space requirements.
